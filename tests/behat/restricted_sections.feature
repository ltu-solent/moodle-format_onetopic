  Scenario: First two sections are locked for a course in modules_ category
    Given the following config values are set as admin:
      | locksections | 2 | format_onetopic |

    And I am on "C1" course homepage with editing mode on
    And I click on "Topic 2" "link" in the "#page-content ul.nav.nav-tabs" "css_element"
    When I open the action menu in ".section_action_menu" "css_element"
    Then I should see "Edit section" in the ".section_action_menu" "css_element"
